# Chime Chat
Chime Chat is a Chrome (Brave, etc) Extension for adding comments and having a conversation on ANY website

Let's say you want to share your opinion about an article on the Web with the world. 
You first think of Twitter or any social media, post the URL and expect a conversation.

But that is closed to the people who is following you.
You want your comment to reach other people... difficult!

Using Chime Chat you can add your thoughts on the actual website space and other users and reply or add their own comments.

##Â Post in websites you are not allowed to add comments
Many websites today block access if you are not paying or if the user didn't accept you as part of the group.

Post anyways!
